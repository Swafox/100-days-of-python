## What is this?
From _7th of November 2020_ I am starting a 100 Days Of Python Challenge in which I am going to code and upload some python programs here.

## What do I want to achieve?
First of all, I want to boost my python skills by coding everyday. Persistance in learning always gives the best outcome.
Secondly, this challenge will develop a certain discipline in me as I will have to invest a part of my every single day into this challenge. 

## Finished
I have to end the challenge early since my main source of challenges has went private.
